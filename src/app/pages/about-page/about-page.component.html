    <h2>So, you cold?</h2>
    <p>Like you, I used to think the world was this great place where everybody lived by the same standards I did, then some
      kid with a nail showed me I was living in his world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where righteousness
      is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're gonna have to pay
      the price. </p>

    <h2>Oh... what I'm gon' do?</h2>
    <p>You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How it's possible,
      how it's done, what the dangers are. But then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft encounters a black
      hole does the computer call it an 'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't know, that means we never
      told anyone. And if we never told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die down here. Just as a matter of
      deductive logic. </p>

    <h2>I can do that</h2>
    <p>The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island. Dr.
      Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture the amino
      acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die. </p>

    <h2>I'm serious as a heart attack</h2>
    <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed
      is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly
      his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious
      anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My
      vengeance upon thee. </p>

    <h2>I took lessons</h2>
    <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't
      get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it
      too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're
      on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>
